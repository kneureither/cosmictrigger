# Testing routines of the Cosmic Trigger
### Comment of the developer, january 2021

Please treat the code in this folder with caution, after some final refactoring it was not debugged anymore.
Still it might offer some insights on some testing routines, that were also build into some of the modules of
the code, such as the Pattern Engine, as well as the Template Bank. 

I am sorry, that I cannot offer a complete and well debugged testing framework. I would have liked to setup 
a continous integration system, but I unfortunately haven't had time to do so. These test are very quickly crafted
and served the purpose of debugging in the first place, but I highly recommend to test again with more elaborate methods
if you are unsure on how specific parts of the code work. 


Best,
